Welcome to the PepQuery2 workshop!
===================================

**PepQuery2** is a search engine for identifying or validating
known and novel peptide sequences of interest in any local or publicly available
mass spectrometry-based proteomics datasets.
**PepQuery2** exists as a `Web Application <http://pepquery2.pepquery.org/>` and a standalone version.

The standalone version of **PepQuery2** allows users to search more than one billion MS/MS data indexed 
in the PepQueryDB from any computers with internet access. It also supports direct analysis of user provided 
MS/MS data, any public datasets in PRIDE, MassIVE, jPOSTrepo and iProX, or Universal Spectrum 
Identifiers (USIs) from ProteomeXchange.

Check out the :doc: `webapplication` section for an example of how **PepQuery2** works

Check out the :doc:`standalone` section for an example of what else you can do with **PepQuery2**. This section also
shows how the :ref:`installation` of the standalone version works.
