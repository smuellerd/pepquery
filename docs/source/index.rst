Welcome to the PepQuery2 workshop!
===================================

**Pepquery2** is a search engine for identifdying or validating
known and novel peptide sequences of interest in any local or publicly available
mass spectrometry-based proteomics datasets.
**PepQuery2** exists as a Web Application <http://pepquery2.pepquery.org/> and a standalone version.

The standalone version of PepQuery2 allows users to search more than one billion MS/MS data indexed 
in the PepQueryDB from any computers with internet access. It also supports direct analysis of user provided 
MS/MS data, any public datasets in PRIDE, MassIVE, jPOSTrepo and iProX, or Universal Spectrum 
Identifiers (USIs) from ProteomeXchange.

Check out the :doc:`usage` section for examples of how to use PepQuery2, including
how to :ref:`installation` the standalone version.
