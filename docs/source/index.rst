Welcome to the PepQuery2 workshop!
===================================

**Pepquery2** is a search engine for identifdying or validating
known and novel peptide sequences of interest in any local or publicly available
mass spectrometry-based proteomics datasets.
It pulls data from the `Open Food Facts database <https://world.openfoodfacts.org/>`_
and offers a *simple* and *intuitive* API.

Check out the :doc:`usage` section for further information, including
