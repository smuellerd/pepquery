Web Application
=====

Preparation
------------
You can use PepQuery through `PepQuery Web <http://pepquery2.pepquery.org/>`. 
To use PepQuery Web, you don't need to prepare the MS/MS data and protein reference database
or install the PepQuery software. All you need to do is provide the target peptide/protein/DNA sequence
which you want to identify. 

Identifying novel peptides

from the KRAS G12D mutation?

- How many ?
